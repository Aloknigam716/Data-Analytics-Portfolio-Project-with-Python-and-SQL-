This project demonstrates end-to-end data analytics skills using Python and SQL.
It covers the process of data cleaning, transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization. SQL is used for querying and data manipulation, while Python libraries (like Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, etc.) are used for analysis and reporting.

Tech Stack : 

Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.)
SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite â€“ mention whichever you used)
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
